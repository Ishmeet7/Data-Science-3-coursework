### Problem Statement

We use two csv files. The ‚Äúlandslide_data3_miss.csv‚Äù is a file that contains
some missing values. The ‚Äúlandslide_data3_original.csv‚Äù is the original file without
any missing values. This dataset contains the readings from various sensors installed at 10 locations
around Mandi district. These sensors give the details about the factors like temperature, humidity,
pressure etc.

Following are the details of the attributes in the data:

 *dates: date of collection of data.
 
 *stationid: Indicates the location of the sensor.
 
 *temperature: Atmospheric temperature around the sensor in Celsius.
 
 *humidity: The concentration of water vapor present in the air (in g.m-3).
 
 *pressure: Atmospheric pressure in millibars (mb).
 
 *rain: Measure of rainfall in ml.
 
 *lightavgw/o0: The average light throughout the daytime (in lux units).
 
 *lightmax: The maximum lux count by the sensor.
 
 *moisture: indicates the water stored in the soil (measured between 0 to 100 percent).

 Write a Python program (with pandas) to do the following on the data file
‚Äúlandslide_data2_miss.csv‚Äù.
1. Plot a graph of the attribute names (x-axis) with the number of missing values in them (yaxis).
2. (a). Target attribute is ‚Äústationid‚Äù, Drop the tuples (rows) having missing value in the target
attribute. Print the total number of tuples deleted.
(b). Delete (drop) the tuples (rows) having equal to or more than one third of attributes with
missing values. Print the total number of tuples deleted.
3. After step 2, count and print the number of missing values in each attributes. Also find and
print the total number of missing values in the file (after the deletion of tuples).
4. Experiments on filling missing values:
a. Replace the missing values by mean of their respective attribute. (Use
df.fillna() with suitable arguments.)
i. Compute the mean, median, mode and standard deviation for each attributes
and compare the same with that of the original file.
ii. Calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) between the original and
replaced values for each attribute. (Get original values from original file
provided). Compute RMSE using the equation (1). Plot these RMSE with
respect to the attributes.
b. Replace the missing values in each attribute using linear interpolation technique. Use
df.interpolate() with suitable arguments.
i. Compute the mean, median, mode and standard deviation for each attributes
and compare with that of the original file.
i. Calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) between the original and
replaced values for each attributes. (Get original values from original file
provided). Compute RMSE using the equation (1). Plot these RMSE with
respect to the attributes.
Note: RMSE is computed between the replaced value and its corresponding original value.
You are computing RSME for each attribute. Let Na be the number of missing values in
attribute ‚Äòa‚Äô. Let ùë•^i be the replaced value and xi be the original value of ith missing
value. Then the RMSE for attribute ‚Äòa‚Äô is computed as:
RMSE - Rootmean square error
where N is the number of data points, y(i) is the i-th measurement, and y ÃÇ(i) is its corresponding 
prediction.
5. Outlier detection:
a. After replacing the missing values by interpolation method, find and list the outliers
in the attributes ‚Äútemperature‚Äù and ‚Äúrain‚Äù. Outliers are the values that does not
satisfy the condition (Q1 ‚Äì (1.5 * IQR)) < x < (Q3 + (1.5 * IQR)), where x is the
value of the attribute, IQR is the inter quartile range, Q1 and Q3 are the first and
third quartiles. Obtain the boxplot for these attributes.
b. Replace these outliers by the median of the attribute. Plot the boxplot again and
observe the difference with that of the boxplot in (5i).
